With a strong academic foundation, hands-on experience in building scalable backend systems, and a deep commitment to crafting clean, maintainable code, I am confident in my ability to make an immediate and meaningful contribution to your development team.

I currently work as a Backend Engineer at DigitalOcean, where I am part of the team behind the Cloudways managed hosting platform.
My responsibilities span designing robust API services, contributing to infrastructure decisions, and translating complex business
requirements into performant, production-ready code. Previously, I worked at 10Pearls, where I helped architect and build a scalable API
for IoT-based solar-powered generatorsâ€”leveraging technologies such as Flask, Celery, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL.

Some highlights of my background include:

ðŸ¥‡ Gold Medalist from Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute (GIKI) with a CGPA of 3.79/4.00, consistently appearing on the Dean's Honor Roll.

ðŸ”§ Proficient in Python, with strong command over Flask, FastAPI, and asynchronous task management using Celery and RabbitMQ.

ðŸ§  Enthusiastic about system design, clean architecture, and DevOps practices, ensuring that the systems I build are not only functional but also scalable and maintainable.

ðŸ’¡ Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design principles, with a track record of delivering production-level code in collaborative, agile environments.

I am particularly drawn to companies that value engineering excellence, continuous learning, and developer empowerment. I bring a problem-solving mindset, a deep understanding of backend systems, and the curiosity to stay ahead of industry trendsâ€”from containerization and CI/CD pipelines to distributed systems and cloud-native architectures.

Beyond my technical skills, I take pride in being a proactive team playerâ€”comfortable collaborating across functions, mentoring junior developers, and contributing to a healthy engineering culture. My ability to work autonomously, combined with a drive to solve complex problems, makes me an asset in both startup and enterprise settings.

I would be thrilled to bring my backend expertise and passion for innovation to your team.
I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background aligns with your goals and how I can contribute to your continued success.
